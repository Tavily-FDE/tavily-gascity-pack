# Publish to the Gas City registry

The first release is `tavily-fde/tavily` version `0.1.0`. The repository owner
is `Tavily-FDE`; Gas City requires the pack scope to match its lowercase form.
Keep the scoped name in `pack.toml` identical to the submitted name.

## Validate before submitting

1. Confirm `gc version` reports 1.5.0 or later.
2. Import the intended commit into a test city with the README's import command
   and `--version 'sha:<full-commit-sha>'`.
3. Run `gc import check`, `gc config show --validate`, and
   `gc mcp list --agent <agent-name>`. Confirm the Tavily HTTP server appears.
4. Authenticate in the consuming client and run one Search and one Extract
   using the README's prompts. A config check alone does not test OAuth or
   live tools.
5. Commit and push all release files. For the browser flow, merge them into
   the repository's default branch before scanning.

## Submit through GitHub App discovery

1. Install the [Gas City Registry Verifier](https://github.com/apps/gas-city-registry-verifier/installations/select_target)
   under **Tavily-FDE**, selecting **Only select repositories** and
   **tavily-gascity-pack**. Use a GitHub account with repository admin access;
   an organization owner may need to approve the installation.
2. Review the actual GitHub consent screen. At preparation time the app
   requested **Contents: read** and **Metadata: read**. No repository write
   permission is needed for this flow.
3. Sign in at <https://registry.gascity.com/publish> and choose **Find packs**.
   Complete GitHub verification and select this repository's root pack.
4. Review the discovered commit and these values:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Repository | `Tavily-FDE/tavily-gascity-pack` |
   | Pack path | `.` |
   | Pack name | `tavily-fde/tavily` |
   | Version | `0.1.0` |
   | Ref label | The default branch, normally `main` |

5. Click **Submit this pack** and follow the request on the Account page.
   Fix any validation errors before resubmitting. **Pending review** means
   queued; only **Approved** means the release is served in the public catalog
   and CLI registry.

Discovery submits the default branch's current HEAD. Changing the ref label
does not select a different commit. Versions must be stable `major.minor.patch`
strings such as `0.1.0`, without a leading `v` or prerelease suffix.

The registry computes the content hash from the submitted public source;
this direct flow does not require a checked-in `registry.toml` or a change to
Gas City's aggregate repository. Future releases still require staff review.
For tagged releases, follow the official
[GitHub Actions OIDC publishing instructions](https://registry.gascity.com/publish).
Creating or merging a GitHub PR does not itself submit a registry release.
